    "I'm currently working on Machine Learning projects at AMD, mainly working on enhancing heuristic algorithms with the use of ML, optimizing them to be truely data-driven. I'm also passionate about improving ML infrastructure, having worked on tools to delineate black-box models like Random Forests, integrating experiment tracking and model versioning into the workflow, and packaging models in docker for inference. I have one [research publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93258-w) in the development of tools to aid Cognitive Enhancement, and have applied for two patents in the field of Machine Learning in Electronic Design Automation. I'm also enthusiastic about full-stack development and staying current with latest trends in the field."

The state-of-the-art for most of these problems is otherwise based on heuristic algorithms, since the size of the search space to find the most optimal solution increases exponentially with the number of parameters to tune. The inherent complexity of such problems makes it immensely exciting to formulate and implement solutions using ML techniques, and efficient software pipelines for packaging the same into [Vivado ML Edition](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) for use by customers.",
